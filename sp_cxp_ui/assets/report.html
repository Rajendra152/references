The effect of the different treatment groups does not depend upon the value of covariate Age, averaging over the values of the remaining covariates. There is not a significant interaction between the factor Groups and the covariate Age (P = 0.062).


There are no significant interactions between the factor and the covariates. The equal slopes assumption passes and the equal slopes model is analyzed below.


Analysis of Equal Slopes Model:

R = 0.602  Rsqr = 0.362  Adj Rsqr = 0.347
Source of Variation  DF   SS     MS      F       P     
Groups               2    0.229  0.114   9.290   <0.001
Age                  1    0.128  0.128   10.422  0.002 
Residual             125  1.540  0.0123  --      --    
Total                128  2.413  0.0189  --      --    
The differences in the adjusted means among the treatment groups are greater than would be expected by chance; there is a statistically significant difference (P = <0.001). To isolate which group(s) differ most from the others use a multiple comparison procedure. The adjusted means and their statistics are given in the table below.


The coefficient of covariate Age in the equal slopes regression model is significantly different from zero (P = 0.002). The covariate significantly affects the values of the dependent variable.


Adjusted Means of the Groups:

Group Name  Adjusted Mean  Std. Error  95%Conf-L  95%Conf-U
control     1.200          0.0150      1.170      1.230    
exposed 1   1.193          0.0217      1.150      1.236    
exposed 2   1.085          0.0206      1.044      1.126    
The adjusted means are the predicted values of the dependent variable Length for each group where each covariate variable is evaluated at the average of its data values.

control vs. exposed 2    0.115          4.178  <0.001  Yes    
exposed 1 vs. exposed 2  0.109          3.456  0.001   Yes    
control vs. exposed 1    0.00693        0.270  0.787   No     
Regression Equations for the Equal Slopes Model:


There is a significant difference in the intercepts of the dependent variable for these equations since there is a significant difference in the adjusted means of the factor groups (P = <0.001).
